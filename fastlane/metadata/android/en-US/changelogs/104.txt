Release notes
Ultrasonic 4.0.0 brings along a complete overhaul of how media is being played back. We have switched to a modern library to handle the playback and fixed wuite a few bugs in the process.
Additionally the Offline mode now supports browsing based on ID3 tags. This requires additional metadata which will be missing for tracks downloaded with previous versions. If you enable this setting, the app will therefore show only the music that you have downloaded with 4.0.0 or later.
